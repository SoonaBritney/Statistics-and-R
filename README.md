# Statistics-and-R

### Project Overview
In R-Analysis, we applied our understanding of statistics and hypothesis testing to analyze a series of datasets from the automotive industry. Our analysis includes visualizations, statistical tests, and interpretation of the results. All of our statistical analysis and visualizations are written in the R programming language.

Throughout the module, we extract, transform, and load (ETL) data; visualize the data; and analyze the data using R. Additionally, we learned a variety of statistical tests, their real-world application in data science, and their implementation in R.

### Resources
1. Data Source: demo.csv, demo.json, demo2.csv, mpg_modified, used_car_data, Vehicle_Data, MechaCar_mpg.csv, Suspension_coil.csv
2. Software: R, RStudio, Rtools

### Objectives
Load, clean up, and reshape datasets using tidyverse in R.
Visualize datasets with basic plots such as line, bar, and scatter plots using ggplot2.
Generate and interpret more complex plots such as boxplots and heatmaps using ggplot2.
Plot and identify distribution characteristics of a given dataset.
Formulate null and alternative hypothesis tests for a given data problem.
Implement and evaluate simple linear regression and multiple linear regression models for a given dataset.
Implement and evaluate the one-sample t-Tests, two-sample t-Tests, and analysis of variance (ANOVA) models for a given dataset.
Implement and evaluate a chi-squared test for a given dataset.
Identify key characteristics of A/B and A/A testing.
Determine the most appropriate statistical test for a given hypothesis and dataset.

### Summary
Load, clean up, and reshape datasets using tidyverse in R.
The tidyverse package contains libraries such as dplyr, tidyr, and ggplot2. These packages work together to help simplify the process of creating transformed data columns, grouping data using factors, reshaping our two-dimensional data structures, and visualizing our results using plots.
